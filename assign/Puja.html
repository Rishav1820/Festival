		Durga Puja, which is often refered to as Durgotsov is the main festival of Hindus. It is massively celebrated in the states of Bengal, Orrisa, Assam as well as Bangladesh. 
	</p>

	<p class="history">
		The history of this massively celebrated festival dates back to very old times, and there have been various sitings about who celebrated it first. But moving aside, Devi Durga is known to be a mythical deity in accordance to Hindu scriptures, who gets bestowed with charecteristic weapons from various gods to kill the devil Mahisashur.
		It is basically a significance of removing all the evils and bringing in purity amongst all living creatures and it epitomises the victory of good over evil.

		The festival is observed in the Indian calendar month of Ashwin, which corresponds to the months of Septemberâ€“October in the Gregorian calendar,and is a ten-day festival,of which the last five are of significance. Durga puja is believed to commemorate Devi Durga's visit to her natal home along with her children Lakshmi, Swaraswati, Kartikeya and Ganesha. The festival marks its begining from <a href="Mahalaya.html" target="#">Mahalaya</a>, a day which marks the advent of Devi Durga from her marital home in Kailash. The next significant day is the sixt day, i.e MahaSashti, on which devotees welcome the goddess and her children and the festive celebrations are inaugarated. The seventh(MahaSaptami), eighth(MahaAshthami), nineth(MahaNabami) mark the main days of worship with recitation of scriptures and pujas. The tenth(Dashami) marks the end of the festival as the sculptures get immersed in the water(refered to as Pratima Bisorjon) by the devotees as she descends towards her marital home after the 5day stay at her natal.
